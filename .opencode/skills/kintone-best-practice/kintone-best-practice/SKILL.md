# kintone Best Practices

This skill provides official guidelines for developing on the kintone platform.

## When to Use

- **Writing JavaScript Customizations**: To ensure code is safe, compatible, and maintainable.
- **Using kintone REST API**: To follow performance rules and best practices.
- **Security Reviews**: To check for common vulnerabilities like XSS or credential leaks.
- **Code Reviews**: To verify compliance with kintone's coding standards.

## Usage Instructions

### 1. JavaScript Coding

For rules regarding variables, DOM manipulation, and URL handling:

- **Read**: [references/javascript-guidelines.md](references/javascript-guidelines.md)

**Key Points**:

- Use IIFE or block scope to avoid global variable pollution.
- Do NOT rely on kintone's internal DOM structure (id/class attributes).
- Use `kintone.api.url()` for URL generation.

### 2. Secure Coding

For security requirements and preventing vulnerabilities:

- **Read**: [references/secure-coding.md](references/secure-coding.md)

**Key Points**:

- Prevent XSS by avoiding `innerHTML` with untrusted data.
- Never store secrets (API keys) in frontend code; use Plugin Proxy.
- Validate URLs to prevent open redirects.

### 3. General & API Best Practices

For REST API usage and general development tips:

- **Read**: [references/general-practices.md](references/general-practices.md)

**Key Points**:

- Avoid massive parallel requests.
- Use Bulk APIs for data operations.
- Be aware of kintone update impacts.

## Quick Checklist for Developers

1. **Scope**: Is all code wrapped in an IIFE (`(() => { ... })();`)?
2. **Globals**: Are you modifying `window` or `cybozu` objects? (Don't!)
3. **Selectors**: Are you selecting elements by auto-generated IDs? (Don't! Use API or custom elements).
4. **XSS**: Are you using `innerHTML`? (Use `innerText` or `textContent`).
5. **Secrets**: Are credentials hardcoded? (Use Proxy or Backend).
